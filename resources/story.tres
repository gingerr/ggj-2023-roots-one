The root of all evil

[TLDR] Kill the evil square roots (results are no natural numbers)
and let the others pass.


The intergalactic brain has chosen you for an important mission:

The natural order is danger. On the planet "SquareRoot" the 
leaders have chosen to rise a rebellion. For hundreds of years
there has been peace according to the agreement to only sent
roots into the universe that compute to natural numbers. This made
sure, that all the citizens of the universe preserve their sanity.

You are now the last defense between madness and sanity. With your
trustworthy battleship you have to shoot down all mad roots and make 
sure they don't reach the intergalactic gateway.
