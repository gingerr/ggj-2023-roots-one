# Chat GPT Ideen zu unserem Spiel
## provide a game idea for a space side scrolling game where a spaceship shoots on mathematic roots
In this side-scrolling space shooter, players control a spaceship that must navigate through an asteroid field while shooting at various math-based enemies. The enemies take the form of roots, such as square roots and cube roots, and they are constantly approaching the player's ship. To defeat them, players must use their laser weapons to shoot at the roots and reduce them to their simplified form. For example, to defeat a square root, players must shoot it until it becomes a 1. As they progress through the levels, the roots become increasingly complex and difficult to defeat. Power-ups and upgrades can be collected along the way to help the player's ship become stronger and more equipped to handle the challenges ahead. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the asteroid field and defeat the final boss, which takes the form of an extremely complex root.

## now make the game about solving roots in year head
In this side-scrolling space adventure, players control a spaceship that is traveling through the year head to solve various math-based roots. The roots appear as obstacles in the player's path, and they must be solved to clear the way and progress through the levels. To solve a root, players must use their onboard computer to input the correct solution. The roots start out simple, but as the player advances through the levels, they become increasingly complex and challenging. Along the way, players can collect power-ups that enhance their ship's abilities and help them solve the roots more quickly. The ultimate goal of the game is to reach the end of the year head and solve the final root, which is the most difficult one of all. With fast-paced gameplay, challenging puzzles, and a futuristic setting, this game is sure to provide hours of entertainment for fans of math and space exploration.
